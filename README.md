# Imba guide

This is a quick guide to the [Imba](http://imba.io/) language and web 
development platform.

Imba is a general purpose programming language that compiles to JavaScript and 
is optimized for writing performant front end web applications.

## Requirements

System packages:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (for documentation generator)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (for the playground)

Install the dependencies for the Sphinx documentation generator:

- Go into the repository directory
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Install the dependencies for the playground:

- Go into the repository directory
- Run `npm install`

## Quick start

To build the documentation, go to the project directory and run 
`npm run build:docs`.

The compiled documentation should be present in `site/index.html`. Open 
that file in your browser.

You can also read the source Markdown files [directly](docs/index.md).

## Using the playground

The playground is a simple Imba module that is set up to compile using Webpack.
The idea is to open the compiled code and the source side-by-side and compare
the source to the output.

To start the automatic compilation, run `npm run watch`. The compiled
JavaScript will appear in `dist/client.js`.

To start the development web server, run: `npm run start`. 

**NOTE:** The development server will not compile your playground code into
`dist/client.js`, so if you wish to keep track of the compiler output, you
should run both `watch` and `start` scripts

## Directory structure

- `docs/` - documentation source (`index.md` is the starting point)
- `build/` - generated HTML for the documentation (appears after running 
  `npm run build:docs`)
- `code/` - playground code
- `dist/` - compiled JavaScript for the playground

## Contributing

If you wish to contribute to this project, you may find it helpful to know
that the project uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). The 
`npm run watch:docs` command will spin up a local server on port `8000` that 
will update as you edit.

## Publishing the docs on GitHub Pages

The documentation is published to GitHub Pages with `npm run gh-publish`.

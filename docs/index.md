# Imba guide

This is a quick guide for Imba v1.3, which focuses on the language itself. For 
an introduction to Imba features, please refer to the official website at
[imba.io](https://imba.io/).

This quick guide is aimed at programmers coming from different languages, not 
just JavaScript programmers. Many concepts are explained in detail even when 
they are identical or very similar in JavaScript.

If you are coming from JavaScript, though, you may still want to read through
it as a refresher for some of the concepts. Or you may simply skip from one
code snippet to another, and only read the surrounding text if the code looks
unfamiliar. You will also find [a section](./javascript.md) on tips and gotchas
for JavaScript developers, that cover some of the common pitfalls.

If you wish to follow along, we recommend you hop on 
[Scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com/), an online sandbox/screencast service 
written in Imba.

We will cover setting up Imba projects from scratch in one of the sections.

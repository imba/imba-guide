# Imba guide

This is a quick guide for Imba v1.3, which focuses on the language itself. For 
an introduction to Imba features, please refer to the official website at
[imba.io](https://imba.io/).

One of the most notable features is the built-in fast DOM reconciler, which
allows Imba developers to easily create performant web applications. The
performance of the DOM reconciler is so good, in fact, that Imba opens the
doors to new architectural patterns that were not possible with today's
main-stream font end frameworks like React, Vue and Angular.

## Who this guide is for

This quick guide is **aimed at programmers coming from different languages**,
not just JavaScript programmers. Many concepts are explained in detail even
when they are identical or very similar in JavaScript.

On the other hand, the Imba guide leaves out many details concerning the
browser APIs. They are not part of the Imba language, but they *are*
necessary to build real-life web applications. If you are not familiar with
these APIs, you will find the documentation [on the Mozilla Developer
Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API).

**If you are coming from JavaScript**, you may still want to read
through this guide as a refresher for some of the concepts. Or you may simply
skip from one code snippet to another, and only read the surrounding text if
the code looks unfamiliar. You will also find [a section](./javascript.md) on
tips and gotchas for JavaScript developers, that cover some of the common
pitfalls.

## How to use this guide

We recommend you get as hands-on as possible while reading through this guide.

If you wish to follow along, we recommend you hop on 
[Scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com/), an online sandbox/screencast service
written in Imba. You can also use the playground found in this guide's git repository. Instructions for getting started with the playground are in the `README.md` file.

We will cover setting up Imba projects from scratch in [one of the appendices](./appendices/setup.md).

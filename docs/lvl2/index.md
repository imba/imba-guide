# Advanced concepts

This level builds on the previous one by introducing advanced concepts that 
most non-trivial Imba applications will have. It's primary goal is to introduce
language features, so it will not try to go too deep into advanced programming
topics like object-oriented programming and design patterns. We will, however,
touch on those topics as appropriate.

After clearing this level, you will be able to write complete Imba
applications.
